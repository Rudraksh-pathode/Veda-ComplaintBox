# VEDA – Complaint Box for College Students

## Team Details

- Complaint categorization and prioritization  
- 24-hour escalation system for unresolved issues

The platform is built to be visually engaging, emotionally aware, and impact-driven—encouraging students to raise concerns safely and effectively.
